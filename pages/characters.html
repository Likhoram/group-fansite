                        <p>
                        Kevin, played by Culkin, is the bratty youngest kid of the McCallister family, who, after being left home by mistake when his family rushes off on a flight to Paris, learns to appreciate them.
                    </p>
                        <p>
                            His mea culpa occurs after he spends days alone, having to fend for himself. Oh, and he also has to ward off burglars Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), known as the Wet Bandits.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The performance by Culkin, who was 10 at the time of filming, was so good it would define his career.
