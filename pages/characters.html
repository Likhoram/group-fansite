                        <h4>Role in the Movie:</h4>
                        <p>
                        Kevin, played by Culkin, is the bratty youngest kid of the McCallister family, who, after being left home by mistake when his family rushes off on a flight to Paris, learns to appreciate them.
                    </p>
                        <p>
                            His mea culpa occurs after he spends days alone, having to fend for himself. Oh, and he also has to ward off burglars Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), known as the Wet Bandits.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The performance by Culkin, who was 10 at the time of filming, was so good it would define his career.

                        <p>
                            Culkin, 45, had unbelievable fame through most of his childhood due to "Home Alone" and its sequel, "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York."
                    </p>
                        <p>
                            Since 2019, he's appeared in episodes of shows such as "Dollface," "American Horror Story," "The Righteous Gemstones," and will appear in the second season of "Fallout."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He also is the cofounder of the pizza-themed comedy rock band Pizza Underground and the CEO of a satirical pop-culture website and podcast called Bunny Ears.

                        <p>
                            Pesci's Harry is the perfect villain for a kid-friendly movie.One-half of the "Wet Bandits" (because they flood the houses they steal from).
                    </p>
                        <p>
                            Harry thinks he's got all the angles figured out. That includes how to do the big score of robbing a block of big fancy houses as their owners are all away for Christmas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But Harry, with his shiny gold tooth, didn't count on Kevin to ruin his plans to rob the McCallister house, which he's always had his eye on.

                        <h4>Actor's Career:</h4>
                        <p>
                            When "Home Alone" came out, Pesci was known best for his tough guy roles in Martin Scorsese movies such as "Raging Bull" and "Goodfellas," which opened the same year as "Home Alone" and would earn Pesci an Oscar.
                    </p>
                        <p>
                            Pesci's silly performance as Harry showed a different side of the actor and led to more comedic movies

                            Though Harry is the leader, Marv thinks he's his intellectual equal (though what neither of them know is that they are both idiots) which leads to great comedic moments as the two try to outsmart Kevin.

                            Stern has been a Hollywood fixture going all the way back to his first movie, 1979's "Breaking Away." But around the time of the "Home Alone" release, Stern was at the height of his fame.
